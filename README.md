Dynamical Analysis of Interaction and Structural changes

This is a computational framework for automatically extracting important structural features between two proteins without expertise or experience by simultaneously capturing essential geometric features and their dynamic changes from protein conformational change patterns obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.
